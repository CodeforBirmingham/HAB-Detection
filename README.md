HAB-Detection
=============
Mobile application that allows users to take a picture of potential HAB observed and submit a report of the sighting. Aid users in describing their observations by asking series of questions about the HAB and generate information about the location where the HAB was sighted (i.e. name of water body, proximity to water treatment facility, etc) using GPS features of usersâ€™ smart phones.
